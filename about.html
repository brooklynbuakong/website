    <h1>What I Have Learned</h1>
    
    <p>I learned/ am learning many useful things in computer science. One of the useful things is what we are doing currently, which is 
      html. I can use html when creating a web page and it is the easiest way of creating. Soon I will be learning about programming, 
      which seems pretty interesting.</p>

    <p>My name is Brooklyn Buakong and this is my website for a community problem. I have created this website using html and CSS.
      Computer science was suprisingly easy, especially using html. I have gotten really used to the different tags and the different
      styling. I like the styling aspect because you anyone can create something and style it however they want. That is something I
      have wanted to explore, the variety of styling a document.</p>
