    <h1>California's Water Crisis</h1>
    
    <p>The problem concerns people who care about California's water. Water, including 
    the ocean and rivers, are being polluted, ot even from our littering, but from chemical
    spills. This is one part of the issue with California's water. The other part is the 
    drought. The water supply is decreasing as the climate increases. 75% of the state's 
    precipitation, occurs in Northern California, but Southern California needs 75% of the
    entire stata's water.

    <h1>How Is It Getting Resolved?</h1>
    
    <p>The downside on this subject is that California is barely doing anything to solve 
    this problem. There were no significant infrastructure investments made since the 70s.
    People must try to expand water storage facilities, which some have achieved. There has
    been development on California's reservoir space for future temperature changes.</p>

    <h1>Water Efficiency</h1>
    
    <p>Institutions regulate the prices for water and how much they should cost depending 
    where it is being sold. For example, water is priced below market value in urban and 
    agricultural areas. Yet, increasing the prices will change water demand, still is not 
    effective. Research studies show that increasing water prices may decrease agricultural
    water demand. It is very important for people to keep trying to be aware of the water 
    supply and find sustainable funding for it as well. Once the changes have been made, 
    people in California can have reliable water.</p>
