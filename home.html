    <h1>Computer Science/What I Have Learned</h1>
    
    <p>Computer science is the study of computers or the use of them. There are many parts
    to this study. For example, right now we're learning how to use html and CSS to create 
    a website. Other parts include engineering, graphics, and programming systems. So far
    through the school year, I have learned another way to create pages and how to syle them,
    which is very interesting. Within use of CSS, I can create tables and boxes, so there
    is an even broader part of what one can do with html and CSS.</p>

    <h1>What is This Page?</h1>
    
    <p>This page is relevant because I am learning how to create a website and this is it.
    Using some basic website structure, I have created my very own webpage using html and 
    CSS. Throughout this website, there will be links to see this page, an "about me" page,
    and the main page. This website also shows each individual's creativity because everyone
    made a website their own way.</p>
